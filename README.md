Welcome to my path finder exercise.

Breadth first search, depth first search, Dijkstra and A* are four useful path finding algorithms. Since breadth first and Dijkstra are identical when there's no terrain involved, only three are built here.

They work like this:

A*:

Dijkstra:

Depth first:

The first two algorithms guarantee the shortest path possible. Depth first is less demanding on memory space.
